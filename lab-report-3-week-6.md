# Lab Report 3 - More SSH Stuff

## Choice 1 - Streamlining SSH Configuration
In the beginning, I did not have a .ssh/config path, so I had to use the Windows command `$null > config` in order to create a config file.

Here is my config file, initially the content of the file was empty, so I used VS Code in order to edit the config file.

After the config file is complete, I can log in to the remote computer with the new username I made.
