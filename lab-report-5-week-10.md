## Test-File with Different Results

I have chose to compare two test files 212.md and 230.md out of the 652 tests provided.

[212.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/212.md)

[230.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/230.md)

## Analysis of 212.md

my output vs. other output

Both implementations are incorrect because 212.md contains no links, so the program should return an empty ArrayList
