## Part 1: Setting Up Visual Studio Code
Using a browser, I searched online to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Since my laptop uses Windows, I downloaded VSCode for Windows x64.

I went to my downloads in file explorer and ran VSCodeUserSetup-x64 to install and launch VSCode for the first time.

## Part 2: Remotely Connecting
In order for my laptop to be connected to a remote computer, I installed the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension in VSCode. On the other hand, I could of also installed OpenSSH for Windows.

I would access the terminal tab to generate q new terminal and type/enter `ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (where zz represents my account username).

Then I would type/enter yes to the first time prompt and enter my `Password:` (hidden while typing) and was [changed](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) prior for setup.
