## Part 1: Setting Up Visual Studio Code
Using a browser, I searched online to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Since my laptop uses Windows, I downloaded VSCode for Windows x64.

I went to my downloads in file explorer and ran VSCodeUserSetup-x64 to install and launch VSCode.
