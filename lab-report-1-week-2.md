## Part 1: Setting Up Visual Studio Code
Using a browser, I searched online to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Since my laptop uses Windows, I downloaded VSCode for Windows x64.

I went to my downloads in file explorer and ran VSCodeUserSetup-x64 to install and launch VSCode for the first time.

## Part 2: Remotely Connecting
In order to connect to a remote computer from my laptop, I installed [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) through VSCode as an extension. On the other hand, I could of installed OpenSSH for Windows.
